It is an important centre for maritime industries and maritime trade in Europe. The city is home to many companies within the maritime sector, some of which are among the world's largest shipping companies, shipbrokers and maritime insurance brokers.

    "            \" The goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves. Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.\"\n",
    "tx3 = \"Trondheim has a very mild climate for its northerly latitude, resulting in moderate summers and winters that often remain above the freezing point in seaside areas. On higher elevation, though, the microclimate is colder and snowier. The city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Trøndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Trøndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\"\n",
